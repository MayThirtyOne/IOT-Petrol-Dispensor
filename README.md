# IOT-Petrol-Dispensor
Automated Petrol Dispensor using RFID sensor and card

# Description
This project was completed as a part of the course curriculum. We programmed an Arduino board to detect valid RFID cards from customers. It took input for the volume of fuel needed via a 3X3 keypad and through a local webserver, it was able to track customer identification, prepaid balance, receipt, and other vital information. After performing the required calculations in the backend, a 7 segment display outputs the important information to the customer.

# Technologies Used
C/C++, Python

# Hardware Used
Arduino UNO, 7-Segment Display, RFID Sensor and Card

# Project Background
Now a day everything has been digitized. For example online banking, cash management, tax filing, and computerized petrol pump. Considering the computerized petrol pump, a lot of work has been already done in this field. That is some petrol companies provide smart cards to the customers to access the petrol at the petrol station in their company. But in our system we are using RFID card to access petrol at different petrol stations of different companies petrol across the country and here, we are connecting all these petrol stations using a single web server and this webserver access is secured by a password which is known only to the petrol companies. On this web server, we are maintaining the information of the customers (like petrol dispensed amount and available balance of the card). And even that information is sent to the customer mobile phone using the GSM module. Here we are providing an RFID card to each customer with which customers can access petrol at the petrol stations. Before using this card, we have to recharge it like a prepaid card. Whenever we want to fill the tank just, we have to place the RFID card near the RFID reader.

Then the microcontroller reads the data from the RFID reader and acts according to the customer. This system also provides security for the customers for petrol filling at the Petrol stations by avoiding the involvement of human beings, so to avoid the risk of carrying money every time.
